My Vision is first of all an explanation of the chapter. Before hand, like an introduction. Then throwing the formal definitions, formal explanation just like in class (the boring and strict way). And then a tone change, "אבל מה זה אומר, תכל'ס?" or "מה לעזעזל קראתי!?" (switch between the two throughout the course) - כן זה למטה. Really dumb it down like we are in the street and you are explaining it to someone who doesn't study the material or to a friend. (slang / casual / like im 5)

Deep dive on the topic in formal way, further explanations / examples and everything that is needed to learn and teach about the topic. If you need you can search the web to populate the page more with examples, different POVs on the topic and a different approach. Further provide more examples and then, (if eligible) provide example for the implamantation of this topic (if there is one). why / how we use what we are study how it affects things, how will we see it on the test / in what form. Interactive component that illustrates the idea, illustrates the concept.... perhaps the start of a small exercise, an illustration, an image, something tangible. And then another explanation that summarisez until now in an eye to eye level language, like, you were explaining to, a friend,  use analogies from a day-to-day life in Tel Aviv as a student as a young man living in Tel Aviv (so many area of intrests and funny analogies to take from) . And then full-on exercises with step-by-step solutions and interactive components that reveals the steps of the solutions one at a time (or a different interactive method (pop quiz, pick & match, memory game, multiple choice with timer). wrap the topic with a trivia like, did you know?, fun fact card which is not a study material but more an extra and fun / intresting fact to know. 
Design should be compact, clean, not boring, formal academic literature should be kept intact when explaining in a formal way, Emojis can be used to illustrate certain idea in a sentence or a paragraph and tool-tips should be used for uncommon / new terms that explain in 1 sentence what the term is with info bubble while hovering over them. And at the end, a linking sentence to the next chapter "בפרק הבא... נעשה / נלמד / נראה איך..) to what is gonna be on the next chapter.
