# Brainstorming Workflow

1.  **Understand the Context**
    -   Read the current project state (files, docs, recent commits) to understand the context.

2.  **Refine the Idea**
    -   Ask the user questions one at a time to refine the idea.
    -   Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.
    -   Prefer multiple choice questions.

3.  **Explore Approaches**
    -   Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs.
    -   Lead with a recommendation and explain why.

4.  **Present the Design**
    -   Once the idea is clear, present the design in sections (200-300 words).
    -   Check with the user after each section.
    -   Cover architecture, components, data flow, error handling, and testing.

5.  **Document and Plan**
    -   Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
    -   Commit the design document.
    -   Ask the user if they are ready to set up for implementation.
