# Topic: Supply and Demand Shifts

When the price of coffee beans rises, the supply of coffee decreases (shifts left). This causes the equilibrium price to rise and quantity to fall.
Conversely, if a new technology improves harvesting, supply increases (shifts right), lowering price.

**Key Definitions:**
*   **Supply Curve:** A graph showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied.
*   **Equilibrium:** The point where supply equals demand.

**Binary Concepts:**
*   **Shift Left:** Bad weather, higher costs, taxes.
*   **Shift Right:** Good weather, lower costs, subsidies.
