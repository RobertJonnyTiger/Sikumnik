# Topic: Opportunity Cost

The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.

## Numeric Example
Israel can produce 100 Guns or 500 tons of Butter.
If Israel produces 100 Guns, it produces 0 Butter.
If it produces 99 Guns, it can produce 5 tons of Butter.
Therefore, the opportunity cost of the 100th Gun is 5 tons of Butter.
