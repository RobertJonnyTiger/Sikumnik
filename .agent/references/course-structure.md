## [3] 🌆 טיזר אנלוגי — TEASER ANALOGY

**Hat**: 🎭 Conductor  
**Tone**: Casual, relatable, Tel Aviv student life

### Must Include:
- ONE paragraph only (3-5 sentences max)
- Analogy from daily life that relates to the chapter topic
- Emotional hook BEFORE formal content
- Must end with: "...ועכשיו בואו נראה את זה בצורה מסודרת"

### Good Analogy Sources:
- Wolt / delivery apps

- Rent in Tel Aviv
- Coffee shop studying
- Dating apps
- Campus life
- Bars / nightlife
- Bank account / ATM

### Example: 
דמיין שאתה מנסה לשכור דירה בתל אביב. בעל הדירה שואל:
"מה המצב הכלכלי שלך?" אז אתה עושה מאזן מהיר בראש —
כמה כסף יש לך, כמה אתה חייב על הלימודים, מה שווי האוטו שלך.
מזל טוב — עשית מאזן בלי לדעת. ועכשיו בואו נראה את זה בצורה מסודרת.

Every time after: just use "הון עצמי" normally.

## [5] 🔀 שבירת טון — TONE BREAK

**Hat**: 🎭 Conductor  
**Tone**: Street-level casual, like explaining to a friend

### Opener (alternate by chapter number):
- **ODD chapters** (1, 3, 5...): "אבל מה זה אומר, תכל'ס?"
- **EVEN chapters** (2, 4, 6...): "מה לעזעזל קראתי עכשיו!?"

### Must Include:
- Re-explain EVERYTHING from section [4]
- Use casual Hebrew, slang allowed
- Use humor where it helps
- Emojis to illustrate points (don't overdo)
- Like explaining to a 5-year-old or a friend at a bar

### Goal:
Every formal concept should get a one-liner casual translation.

### Example:
מה לעזעזל קראתי עכשיו!? 🤯

אוקיי, בוא נוריד הילוך.

ישות נפרדת = החברה שלך היא לא אתה. שני כיסים נפרדים.
עלות היסטורית = קנית משהו? רושמים כמה שילמת, לא כמה הוא שווה עכשיו.
שמרנות = תכין את עצמך לגרוע. הפסדים — רושמים מיד. רווחים — רק כשבטוח.
